#24 Hour MapLesotho Mapathon#
What's happening? > There will be another huge 24 hour mapathon on the 5th of May in Portmarnock Community School. It will begin at 8am that day, and continue through the night until 8am on the 6th of May. There were two previous mapathons like this, but this one is focussed on higher quality mapping. From previous experience a lot of work gets done, and a lot of teaching and learning on openstreetmap takes place. Over 80 young Mappers will participate, and will stay up most of the night to make their contribution.
Why is this being done? > There are three objectives. The first is to get time mapping, and strengthen the mapping skills of a broader number of kids in the school - the interest in humanitarian mapping is something that the pupils have previously won [social innovators](http://www.youngsocialinnovators.ie/press/students-from-portmarnock-community-school-young-social-innovators-of-the-y) awards for, and got to represent Ireland in 2016. The second is to make a serious contribution to helping the current phase of mapping to get finished. The third is to collect challenge sponsorship from the families and friends of the students involved, and this sponsorship to be added to the funds used by [Action Ireland Trust](http://www.actionirelandtrust.ie/) on their developmental mission in Lesotho.
What about the overall #MapLesotho Project? > The project has reached the big stage for OSM maturity. Over 12 months ago a base-map was completed for the country with 13 million nodes then completed in Lesotho. This is a second wave of mapping passing through the whole country and since it began this phase has added an awesome 8 million nodes. There is a bias in the content of the mapping towards environmental management. All this can be checked on the [osm wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Lesotho) for the project. 
Who may help > There is a call to action for validators to assist the pupils as they complete their tiles. OSM Ireland adults may attend at the school (by prior arrangement). OSM users across the world are invited to participate online and give feedback on the quality of mapping using the HOTOSM task manager.
