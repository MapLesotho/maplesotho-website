<p>#MapLesotho has now reached a point where we are now drawing down the data and we are now at a stage where important conclusions can be drawn about the physical layout of the country.</p>
<p>Through MapLesotho every water body in the country is being mapped, with approximately 80% complete to date. Even in this incomplete state we are able to download the data and import into a PostGIS enabled database. The Lesotho data is <a href="download.geofabrik.de/africa/lesotho.html" target="_blank">downloaded from geofrabik</a> (download.geofabrik.de/africa/lesotho.html) who provide daily snapshots of all the data.</p>
<p>By taking one of the well mapped features streams and rivers, and analysing this in tandem with buildings has allowed us to see the proximity of buildings to waterbodies.</p>
<p>As further localised extract was taken from Leribe in order to assertion the number of buildings and their respective which are potentially at risk from flooding due to proximity watercourses.</p>
<p>It was found that of the buildings mapped in Leribe approximately <strong>38% were at risk of flooding</strong>. When adding features to OSM we use satellite imagery which can be up to 2 years old. When further examining the building type, of those tagged as under construction it was found that <strong>over 50%</strong> of those were at risk of flooding.</p>
