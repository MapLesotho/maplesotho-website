This week has been a great one for Quthing Assistant Physical Planners and the district surveyor. Seven of them were introduced to OpenStreetMap and were trained by 2 training team members [Lineo Mothae](https://twitter.com/Nu_Lineo), [Motsieleli Mafatlane ](https://twitter.com/HIPZO2)and 1 analysis team member [Mats’eliso Thobei](https://twitter.com/Tshedy4). The new mappers were introduced to ID editor, as recommended in [TeachOSM](http://teachosm.org/en/). Everyone was excited to gain the knowledge. They were mapping in tasks.hotosm.org/project/894# which is left mainly with validation.

What I liked about the group was participation, and making sure they understand what OSM was all about. I liked the competitiveness everyone had on the number of edits each of them had.

I am proud of my colleagues and I believe #MapLesotho will move to the next step with them involved.
