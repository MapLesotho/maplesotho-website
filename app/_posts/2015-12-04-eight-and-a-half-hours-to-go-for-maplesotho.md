Hi, I'm Joe. And this is my first blog ever. I hope you like it.

It's nearly half past eleven. That means I've been mapping Lesotho since eight am, making it sixteen and a half hours of OpenStreetMap mayhem in my school.

Wow, everything has happened... we got banned from the OSM server because we were working soÂ hard. When everyone arrived today I was "volunteered" to help create accounts for new users and show them how to use it. Some of my classmates signed to twitter today and are now part of the #MapLesotho community and learned so much, are now all experts and willing to help others.

It was really cool looking at the [leaderboard](http://maplesotho.cbroderick.me/) created by [Colin Broderick ](https://twitter.com/rusty1052)who is helping us map from Belgium.

I'm in 28th place, .....but the night is still young!

This is a great moment for our school as we are contributing to a global cause to make more useful maps for developing countries.
