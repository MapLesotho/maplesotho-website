Mapping this task was a real deal and a great adventure for QN Mappers (APPs). It was not an easy road but it came with positive factors like the much appreciated outside help mentioned above and the  never ending courage they received from the DebigC . all this helped them to overcome any obstacle. QN Mappers(APPs) would also like to recognize her Majesty the the Queen of Maplesotho A.K.A Tshedy,  for being their inspiration. “we want to be a bunch of you.”
