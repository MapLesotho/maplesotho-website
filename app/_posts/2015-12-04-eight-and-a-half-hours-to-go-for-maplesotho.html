<p>Hi, I'm Joe. And this is my first blog ever. I hope you like it.</p>
<p>It's nearly half past eleven. That means I've been mapping Lesotho since eight am, making it sixteen and a half hours of OpenStreetMap mayhem in my school.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_613" align="aligncenter" width="260"]<img class="  wp-image-613 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/joe_teaching.jpg" alt="joe_teaching" width="260" height="235" /> That's me with the cute dimples[/caption]</p>
<p>Wow, everything has happened... we got banned from the OSM server because we were working soÂ hard. When everyone arrived today I was "volunteered" to help create accounts for new users and show them how to use it. Some of my classmates signed to twitter today and are now part of the #MapLesotho community and learned so much, are now all experts and willing to help others.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_607" align="aligncenter" width="251"]<img class="alignnone  wp-image-607" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/progress.jpg" alt="progress" width="251" height="174" /> Now 100% validated, we started at 49% at 8am!![/caption]</p>
<p>It was really cool looking at the <a href="http://maplesotho.cbroderick.me/">leaderboard</a> created by <a href="https://twitter.com/rusty1052">Colin Broderick </a>who is helping us map from Belgium.</p>

<p>I'm in 28th place, .....but the night is still young!</p>
<p>This is a great moment for our school as we are contributing to a global cause to make more useful maps for developing countries.</p>
