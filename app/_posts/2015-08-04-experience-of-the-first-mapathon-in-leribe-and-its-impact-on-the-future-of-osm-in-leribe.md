[![MapLesotho Checklist](https://maplesotho.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/image_471299104.jpg?w=232)](https://maplesotho.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/image_471299104.jpg)The first mapathon in Leribe was very great and got very interesting when we met our colleagues from Maseru District Council. On the first day all was set and ready to mapLesotho from 8 a.m and all the participants were very dedicated to mapping, that was very impressive from my Leribe.

The mapathon ran until 10 p.m and all were very happy that DCs Leribe paid us a visit and she was also impressed. We intend to undertake some training on OSM for other civil servants in Hlotse town which can be extended to other areas in Leribe.

Before undertaking this training i believe giving training to DCs and district council staff will be best. Â Watch out for team **North #MapLesotho**
