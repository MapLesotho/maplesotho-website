<p>Its nearly a year since I started working with Fingal County Council on the #MapLesotho project and in that time a number of great milestones and activities have been completed so of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last July a huge mapathon with users from around the world added over half a million nodes of data for Lesotho</li>
<li>In Sept we had a mapping party in the Lesotho Embassy in Dublin with the Irish OSM community</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A dedicated website has been setup - http://maplesotho.wordpress.com/</li>
<li>A series of classes where held with school children in Dublin teaching them to map and getting them involved in #MapLesotho</li>
</ul>

<p>A number of Irish OSM members / Fingal County Council staff are heading to Lesotho for 2 weeks from Feb 06th to 20th to work on the following:</p>
<p>1. Get the local mappers (there are quite a few now) more involved, editing more frequently and start discussions about them forming a Lesotho OSM group with semi-regular meetups<br />
2. Train govt. planners (most are mappers) on the use of JOSM and OSM data with QGIS<br />
3. Conduct a number of mapping sessions at the national university<br />
4. Meet with govt. data owners to talk about release of (i) data to OSM for imports and (ii) permission to scan, recitfy and derive info from existing maps</p>
<p>We've still got 2 tasks running in the HOT tasking manager since last July's mapathon which we've been silently tipping along on.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/597">Urban Task</a> (mostly buildings) - 52% complete - please focus on Maseru if choosing this one </li>
<li><a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/599">Rural Task</a> (mostly rivers, streams, roads) - 90% complete - </li>
</ul>
<p>With all of this in mind, a number of the folks in Lesotho have set next Friday Jan 16th as a date for the next #MapLesotho mapathon. A large group are coming together in Dublin in the Fingal Council offices to carry out a supporting mapathon.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/lesotho_poster1.jpg?w=676&amp;h=927" alt="#MapLesotho Poster" /></p>
<p>We are looking for other groups around the world to again join in with us in our mapathons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Organise you own mapathon / mapping party</li>
<li>Although it would be nice, it doesn't have to be on the same date so chose a date that suits you</li>
<li>Promote #MapLesotho among your local OSM community. Drop a mail to your local mailing list or see if there are a few folks meeting up, they might like to work on this at their meetup</li>
<li>Join in anytime! The 2 tasks listed above have been running since July so feel free to just jump straight in and take a tile or two.</li>
</ul>
