<p>This week has been a great one for Quthing Assistant Physical Planners and the district surveyor. Seven of them were introduced to OpenStreetMap and were trained by 2 training team members <a href="https://twitter.com/Nu_Lineo">Lineo Mothae</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HIPZO2">Motsieleli Mafatlane </a>and 1 analysis team member <a href="https://twitter.com/Tshedy4">Mats’eliso Thobei</a>. The new mappers were introduced to ID editor, as recommended in <a href="http://teachosm.org/en/">TeachOSM</a>. Everyone was excited to gain the knowledge. They were mapping in tasks.hotosm.org/project/894# which is left mainly with validation.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="line-height:1.7;">What I liked about the group was participation, and making sure they understand what OSM was all about. I liked the competitiveness everyone had on the number of edits each of them had.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Itumeleng Nthunya, Nts'omo Jankie, Tankiso Damane, Bohlokoa Tshabalala, Likeleli Thejane</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="line-height:1.7;">I am proud of my colleagues and I believe #MapLesotho will move to the next step with them involved.</span></p>
