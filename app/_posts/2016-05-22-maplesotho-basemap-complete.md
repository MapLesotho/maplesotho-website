I am really glad to tell you that overnight our fellow mapper [Ben Discoe ](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/bdiscoe)clicked the last green tile. In the last few weeks there was a great effort, almost nostalgic for people to map the simple base-map tasks as they could sense they were running out.

[caption id="attachment_2758" align="alignright" width="201"]![Untitled](https://maplesotho.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/untitled.jpg) 894 the last to finish[/caption]

Great news for MapLesotho as the basemap is completed!!! It has been going since July 2014. In that time of almost two years there were four big tasks:





	
  * #599 #MapLesotho Mapathon – Rural Base Map,

	
  * #894 #MapLesotho – Rural Task 2,

	
  * #597 #MapLesotho Mapathon – Urban Base Map and

	
  * #1169 #MapLesotho – Urban Mapping Task 2


The table below will show the start and finish for each one of them, as well as the number of contributors and biggest contributions in each.

</table>
The four tasks of MapLesotho had more than 400 contributors and with all the tasks completed there are 11,915,128 edits (nodes plus changes to nodes) which are always tracked by [Colin Broderick](http://tasks.hotosm.org/user/RustyB) [here](http://maplesotho.cbroderick.me/). Node creation (literally measuring the expansion of the map) are tracked thanks to the weekly extract by Soren every Sunday [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pB8_n90Ova8YDqXd9BYw_FuB7K3e3VrmJJW9NUG4xOo/pubhtml). This is showing 9,606,320 which is lower than the total for created and changed nodes.

I can’t wait for more details of the second phase tasks being arranged by [Dave Corley](http://www.openstreetmap.org/user/DaCor). I know the objective is to add much better detail to the map, and those details will help me as an Assistant Physical Planner. It is a special day, since for the first time in a long time we don't have any squares to map.
