**It's competition month here again at #MapLesotho, this time it's a different kind of competition, a photo competition with [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com/)!**

![]({{page.banner}})

The competition will run for three months until the end of 2016, with a different objective each month.

As with any competition where's the fun without the rules, there are many so make sure you read them all carefully before entering.

### Entrants
- Entrants will be teams, per district and city (11)
- Teams will have 10 members maximum, and may include non APPs
- Teams will register by providing the Mapillary names of their users
- No teams from **Leribe** OR **Mafeteng** may enter at this time, to prevent distraction from their priority #1 task of mapping being delayed. If either one reaches 50% completeness they may enter the challenge at any point afterwards ([help](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1937) [em out](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1938))
- There can be **more than one device** used by any individual mapper

### Judging
- The three beardies will be judges and Mapillary will provide Ed, Oskido and Sandra as judges.
- Judges will have a remit to look at quality and their decisions will not be appealed and are utterly final

### Prizes
- Prizes will be internet credit
- Ms. Relebohile Lebeta will supervise the purchase of credit
- Prizes will reflect the rolling nature of the competition, i.e. prizes will be awarded at the end of each month and prizes may change from time to time
- Prizes will be awarded on the basis of 1st, 2nd and 3rd
- Teams must share prizes, with a nominated person receiving the credit who will be accountable for access to the credit
