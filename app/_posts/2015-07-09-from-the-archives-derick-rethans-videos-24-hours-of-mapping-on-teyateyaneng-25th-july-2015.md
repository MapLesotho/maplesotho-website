It is almost a year ago since the first global #MapLesotho Mapathon. On that occasion Dave Corley made contact with [Derick Rethans](https://twitter.com/derickr) to track the edits and extract them in the form of a speeded up video.

[Teyateyaneng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teyateyaneng) is a town in Berea, a camptown (capital) for that district. It has a population of 75,000. The name comes from "Place of the shifting sands" in Sesotho. In Fingal County Council his excellency Paramente Phamotse.

The result of Derricks extract is a beautiful documentation of the work of 15-20 mappers based in Fingal County Council clustering their work together within the [Urban ](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/597#)Task. Â Because the visualisation shows midnight to midnight there are no edits for the first seven hours, then as we approach halfway the nodes begin to appear rapidly and as the day winds down to 6pm the node creation stops.

Great work by everyone last year, and superb work by Derek in capturing how one town in #MapLesotho got completed.
