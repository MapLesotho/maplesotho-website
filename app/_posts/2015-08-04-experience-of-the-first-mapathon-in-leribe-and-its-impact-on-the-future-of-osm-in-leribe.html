On the first day all was set and ready to mapLesotho from 8 a.m and all the participants were very dedicated to mapping, that was very impressive from my Leribe.</p>
<p>The mapathon ran until 10 p.m and all were very happy that DCs Leribe paid us a visit and she was also impressed. We intend to undertake some training on OSM for other civil servants in Hlotse town which can be extended to other areas in Leribe.</p>
<p>Before undertaking this training i believe giving training to DCs and district council staff will be best. Â Watch out for team <strong>North #MapLesotho</strong></p>
