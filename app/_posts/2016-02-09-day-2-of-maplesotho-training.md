Wow, what a day!

The second day of training for the 14 #MapLesotho trainees had us break into three groups to focus on our special areas.

I was in the training and engagement group whereby we discussed the mission and objectives of training. There were other groups which were, the technical group and the data analysis group. These three group work hand in hand to reach one goal, which is developing the map of Lesotho.Â I learned today that:



	
  * we need to have a clear mission, on why we are training more people to Map Lesotho

	
  * We need to provide face to face and online engagement

	
  * To have good online engagement we need to design our osm and twitter profiles well.
