The mapping is over after a year of hard work and dedication
by a number of us. We were  used to
seeing the progress chart, and mappers watching how their districts are doing.
Each day came with change, more tiles getting done, changing from white to
orange to green when validation started.

However, some of the districts got this all wrong in terms
of required effort.  That is to say, that
we often appeared to not know the required accuracy and engagement.   That led
to some of the tiles being invalidated and percentages simultaneously increasing
and decreasing at some points, which seemed to frustrate some people. That is a
normal thing for a collaboration involving the work of a lot of people.  The project slack feed would show that a core
of 10 people contributed regularly, and others less frequently. Of the eleven
tasks, only three Qacha's Nek, Quthing and Thaba-Tseka got to 100% done and
validated within the year, the rest either still needed some mapping or some
more validation. 

\#MapLesotho phase II was designed to map the things that
would help planners make plans, therefore we have to move on and make the map
tidier and more useful. As a planner before making plans we have to map what's
there, in that case we would know what's lacking in an area. We still have a
long way to go when it comes to planning. It's true we work at a local level,
but we need guiding tools, there has to be a national plan that guides us as
planners to plan our local areas. #MapLesotho OSM is our foundation to make
National, District then Local plans long into the future, so long as we get the
hard work over with now.
