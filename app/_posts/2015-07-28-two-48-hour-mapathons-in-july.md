title: Two 48 hour Mapathons in July

The 29th and 30th of July are earmarked for two Mapathons to take place in Lesotho.

The Mapathons will take place in Leribe, in the north and Qacha's Nek in the south. The Mapathons were called by the Lesotho Town and Regional Planning Institute at its meeting in June. Assistant Physical Planners are converging on both venues in order to push on the remaining [Urban](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/597#task/804) and [Rural](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/894#task/589) #hotosm tasks.

These Mapathons bring a number of new experiences for the openstreetmap community in Lesotho. First of all they are both outside Maseru, taking on the risks of poor coverge outside the capital. Secondly there are two simultaneous mapathons, which of course are of equal draw and spread out to accomodate most people already mapping Lesotho. Thirdly, the Mapathons are designed to last 48 hours starting tomorrow morning. There will be some tired mappers who will nevertheless enjoy the opportunity to work face to face and learn new skills.

At the time of writing the base-map tasks are 74% (Rural) and 76% (Urban) complete. These Mapathons will be the ones that break these tasks into the home straight. A call was issued to the #hotosm mailing list for help on this one. Everyone looks forward to new tasks which aren't as large as the present ones.
