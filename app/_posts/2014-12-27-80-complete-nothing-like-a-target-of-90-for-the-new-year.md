In case you missed it last night a number of #MapLesotho mappers pushed the rural task over 80% complete and 14% validated. We are almost there!

In the spirit of end of year targets, don't we all love those? We want to break the 90% barrier before the end of 2014! Can you help us? 5 Days. 2% per day. Can we do it!? [Spread the word!](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?status=#MapLesotho%20needs your help to reach 90% by end 2014. Help them - http://bit.ly/map_lesotho)

[Join in!](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/599)

So please steal some time from your employer / study / family this last week of the year and push#MapLesotho over the 90% mark for the new year.
