All #MapLesotho and OpenStreetMap enthusiasts will be aware that Portmarnock Community School are enthusiastic mappers of Lesotho and have entered their activities  into the SAGE World Cup for Social Innovators under a project titled "[Global Citizens Mapping the Future](https://twitter.com/globalcitmtf?lang=en)". 

The project that was entered proved that mapping Lesotho makes data, and these data is re-usable for good social ends in several ways like: 
- planning infrastructure, 
- managing the climate
- supporting better rapid responses to emergencies 

"*What is great about this is that the students went from simply learning how to map to making online applications or writing reports for the Lesotho Government. We knew that before the award*", said Ms Colette Cronin Maths teacher at the school.

To win the Sage World Cup for Social Innovation using this kind of technology is much deserved and very prestigious. Mr Niall FitzGerald, who is the Development Education mentor for these students explains further the significance of the win: "*this award effectively confirms that there is talent in Fingal around emerging opensource technologies the application of that to social entrepreneurship causes. Right now the students are exhausted by the intense scrutiny of competition that they have been through, and are taking a well deserved break*."

This achievement is a credit to the school community, the teachers, the board of management, the partners and sponsors and Fingal County Council who introduced mapping to the school in 2014. However, full credit goes to Colin Mc Andrew, Ravikanth Gollapalli, Ahmed Jouda and Luke Peyton who did all the work and preparation for this win.
