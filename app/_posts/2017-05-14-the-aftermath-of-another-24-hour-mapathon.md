Often,  these 24 hour **mapping sprints** can be draining, to the point that we blog about them the following week after they are done. We [blogged about this](http://www.maplesotho.com/blog/2017/05/04/24-hour-mapathon/) mapathon previously, just for the build up. But until the sleep patterns returned few of us had the clarity to undertake this.

The result was that [five hotosm tasks](http://tasks.hotosm.org/?sort_by=priority&direction=asc&search=Lesotho) in Lesotho leapt ahead in their completeness by about 6% overall, which is impressive considering that they have taken a year to do. The average position with regards to completion is now 91%, while 56% is validated. 

The mapathon day (and night) produced over [384 thousands nodes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kRW1XTcPUoBFwWLzss6ge5YKSZG8KdwkkdG-LKPxh-0/edit?usp=sharing). Considering that there was more of an emphasis on quality, and that several of the students at Portmarnock School were in exam mode and couldn’t participate, this is a handsome return. It was also great to see a hard core of “12 apostles” mapping in Maseru for the 24 hours.
