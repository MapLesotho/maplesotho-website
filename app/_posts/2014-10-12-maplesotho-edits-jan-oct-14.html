<p>We've come along way with #MapLesotho so far this year, where recently we achieved 52% of our rural mapping task complete.</p>
<p>Now maybe is a time to look back at the massive amount of edits made by everyone involved.Over <strong>80</strong> individual mappers have contributed to the map so far. Thank you! There are now over <strong>1.7 million nodes</strong> in Lesotho, where there were only 500,000 in July 2014.</p>
<p>Below is an animation showing the diff's (the changes made to the OSM database) from January to 11th October 2014.</p>

<p>Spread the word we're only counting down to completing the first pass of the Open Street Map basemap for Lesotho now, 48% to go! <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/599" target="_blank">Give us a hand by taking a tile on our HOT OSM Rural Task</a>.</p>
